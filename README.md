# co-opt (Collaborative Optical Tool)

`co-opt` is a web-based application designed to visualize and prototype optical systems. It provides an intuitive interface to manage lens parameters and evaluate optical configurations in the browser.

## 🚀 Overview
The goal of `co-opt` is to make optical design more accessible and collaborative. Unlike traditional proprietary software, `co-opt` runs entirely in the browser and uses an open data format, making it easy to share and iterate on designs.

## 🛠 Hackable JSON Data Format
One of the core philosophies of `co-opt` is its **"Hackability."** All optical systems are handled as simple **JSON files**. This design choice provides several advantages for engineers:
- **Version Control:** Since designs are plain text, you can easily track changes and manage your lens configurations using **Git**.
- **Script Integration:** You can programmatically generate, modify, or analyze lens data using your favorite languages like **Python** or **JavaScript**.
- **Portability:** Effortlessly share configurations by simply copying the JSON string or sharing a URL.

## 🕹 Usage
1. Open [https://yassan8.github.io/co-opt/](https://yassan8.github.io/co-opt/) in a web browser.
2. **Note:** If you don't see any data on startup, click the **"Clear Cache"** button to load the default sample lens data.
3. Use the table interface to add, delete, and modify lens parameters (radius, thickness, material, etc.) and visualize the resulting light paths.

## 📦 GitHub Pages (dist/)
This repo publishes the web app via GitHub Pages from the Vite build output (`dist/`).

- CI build + deploy is defined in `.github/workflows/pages.yml`.
- Local build:
	- `npm run build`
	- `npm run preview`

## 🔁 One-command PR flow
If you want to run **branch creation → commit all files → PR creation → merge** in one command:

Maintenance note: commit/merge automation path validated on 2026-03-09.

- `npm run pr:all`

Optional environment variables:

- `BASE_BRANCH` (default: `main`)
- `BRANCH_NAME` (default: `chore/all-files-pr-<timestamp>`)
- `COMMIT_MESSAGE` (default: `chore: update all pending files`)
- `PR_TITLE` / `PR_BODY`
- `MERGE_METHOD` (`merge` / `squash` / `rebase`, default: `merge`)
- `ALLOW_ADMIN_MERGE` (`1` or `0`, default: `1`)

Example:

- `BASE_BRANCH=main MERGE_METHOD=squash npm run pr:all`

## ✨ Features
- **Dynamic Lens Management:** Add and delete lens blocks as needed.
- **Parameter Control:** Modify curvature, thickness, and glass materials via a table interface.
- **Ray Tracing Visualization:** Visual representation of light paths based on the current lens data.
- **Optimization:** Includes a basic solver to refine lens parameters.

## 🤝 Contributing
Contributions are welcome! Whether it's adding more glass data, improving the ray tracing engine, or enhancing the UI, please feel free to:
1. Submit a **Pull Request**.
2. Open an **Issue** for bug reports or feature requests.
3. Join the discussion in the **GitHub Discussions** tab.
